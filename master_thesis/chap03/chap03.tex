\section{Third Party Call Control}

In the traditional telephony context, third party call control allows one entity (which we call the controller) to set up and manage a communications relationship between two or ore other parties.  Third party call control (referred to as \textbf{3pcc}\label{sym:3pcc}) is often used for operator
services (where an operator creates a call that connects two participants together) and conferencing.\cite{RFC3725}
