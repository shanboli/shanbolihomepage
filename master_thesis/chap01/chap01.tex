\section{Background}
\label{sec:Introduction:Background}

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\label{sym:VoIP} enables the communications between Internet users and the endpoints in PSTN circuit switched (CS)\label{sym:CS} networks. As we know, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely adopted as a signaling protocol for VoIP communications. Because of its simplicity, power and extensibility, it has also been selected by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\label{sym:3GPP} as a major component of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)\label{sym:IMS} for the evolved UMTS core network. 

As the world-leading supplier in telecommunications, Ericsson realizes that the position of VoIP technology in the future of telecom industry is absolutely outstanding. A project named Web Call SDK is planned by the department of Ericsson Developer Connection, to create an application that based on VoIP and make phone to phone calls.
