\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Background:Introduction}

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\label{sym:VoIP} enables the communications between Internet users and the endpoints in PSTN circuit switched (CS)\label{sym:CS} networks. As we know, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely adopted as a signaling protocol for VoIP communications. Because of its simplicity, power and extensibility, it has also been selected by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\label{sym:3GPP} as a major component of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)\label{sym:IMS} for the evolved UMTS core network. 

As the world-leading supplier in telecommunications, Ericsson realizes that the position of VoIP technology in the future of telecom industry is absolutely outstanding. A project named Web Call SDK is planned by the department of Ericsson Developer Connection, to create an application that based on VoIP and make phone to phone calls. 

\section{Task}
\label{sec:Introduction:Task}

The task is to take all of the benefits of VoIP and create a powerful application for phone calls. The application should be simple, stable, reusable, extendable, integratable, easy to access and user friendly. 

It should be a splendid application that supplies the function for users to make phone call anytime, anywhere and to anyone in this world.

\textbf{Web Call SDK \textit{2.0}} is a open source project at \href{http://www.ericsson.com/developer/}{Ericsson Developer Connection}\footnote{Ericsson Developer Connection (former Ericsson Mobility World Developer Porgram) is a department of Ericsson. It helps developers to create applications that incorporate telecommunication network capabilities, such as location-based services, charging, messaging and presence, with sustainability in mind.} (EDC), \href{http://www.ericsson.com/}{Ericsson}\footnote{Ericsson is a world-leading provider of telecommunications equipment and related services to mobile and fixed network operators globally.}. It is the successor project of \textbf{Web Call SDK}\cite{WebCallSDK} which is developed by Yuening Chen at Ericsson AB during the year 2007 and 2008. After Yuening finished Web Call SDK, the people at EDC found it is not stable enough and many of the functions are not usable. So they decided to start a new project follow Web Call SDK to make the it stable and add some new feature to it. The new project is called \textbf{Web Call SDK \textit{2.0}}. As the main developer, I took over the new project at March 2008 and finished it at February 2009. I rewrite most code of the old project to make it stable and runnable and added some new feature to it. As a result, the \textbf{Web Call SDK \textit{2.0}} is used as the base library of Ericsson's demo of \textbf{Using REST and Web Services to Mash Up Communications Capabilities}\cite{DemoAtJavaOne}\cite{EricssonJavaOne} at \href{http://java.sun.com/javaone/}{JavaOne}\texttrademark\footnote{JavaOne is an annual conference (since 1996) put on by Sun Microsystems to discuss Java technologies} 2009.
