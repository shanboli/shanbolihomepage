\section{Background}
\label{sec:Introduction:Background}

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\label{sym:VoIP} enables the communications between Internet users and the endpoints in PSTN circuit switched (CS)\label{sym:CS} networks. As we know, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\label{sym:SIP} is widely adopted as a signaling protocol for VoIP communications. Because of its simplicity, power and extensibility, it has also been selected by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\label{sym:3GPP} as a major component of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)\label{sym:IMS} for the evolved UMTS core network. 

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:Introduction:Problem}




Based on IMS/SIP network technology, Web Call SDK integrated call functions into Web containers. This presents a simple way to implement the communication convergence of Web, IMS/SIP network, and CS networks. It does not require the installation of the plug-in clients on the browser or other special client software as most VoIP services.

Compare to other customer-oriented VoIP products, Web Call SDK offers solutions for developers. It integrated the SIP call function into Web container as Java EE components, providing the example of the convergences between SIP/IMS and the Internet Web technology.
